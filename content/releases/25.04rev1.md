title: Libreboot 25.04 Corny Calamity Revision 1
---

A minor issue was found with AHCI initialisation on the ThinkPad T420, caused
by one of the seven new SeaBIOS patches merged in the release. The seven patches
are largely optional and inconsequential changes, for Libreboot users anyway,
so they have been reverted.

The AHCI bug was was caused on ThinkPad T420 by a patch that *resets* the
state of the AHCI controller, before enabling it, in SeaBIOS. This patch was
written by the author, to make SeaBIOS's AHCI driver work in CSM mode.

For this revision release, that patch is removed, but in Libreboot's master
branch, the SeaBIOS revision is once again up to date, including the seven
recently imported commits, but that version patches SeaBIOS to only apply
the change to AHCI behaviour if SeaBIOS is running as a CSM.

This `25.04rev1` release also contains a missing config for text-mode startup
on the ThinkPad T420.

It is possible that this AHCI issue may have been caused on other mainboards,
but we currently do not know. It is better to assume that all mainboards were
affected, so you should update to the rev1 release if you had the
original 25.04 release.

This revision release was committed to the `25.04_branch` branch, and any
further revision releases will be in the same branch.
