title: Libreboot 20241206 Revision 10
---

This revision has GRUB security fixes, better LVM scanning, and non-root USB2 hub support.

## Revision updates

GRUB released *73 patches* to its main branch, fixing a large number of
security issues. You can read about them here:

<https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/grub-devel/2025-02/msg00024.html>

This updates GRUB to revision `4dc6166571645780c459dde2cdc1b001a5ec844c`
from 18 February 2025. Several OOB heap writes, buffer overflows, use after
frees and so on, are now prevented with this update.

## Feature changes

In addition to the security fixes, several out-of-tree fixes from Libreboot's
main branch have been merged for GRUB, fixing bugs in the xHCI driver, and
adding support for non-root USB2 hubs on platforms that use the `xhci` GRUB
tree.

## Configuration changes

Changes to the GRUB configuration have been made, to make scanning of LVM
volume/group names more reliable, including on full-disk-encryption setups.
More such changes are planned for the next major release; the current changes
are very minor.
