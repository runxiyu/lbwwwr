Introduction
============

**Unavailable in Libreboot 20231106 or earlier. You must [compile from
source](../build/), or use a release newer than 20231106.**

This is a beastly 14" Sandy Bridge platform from HP.
**NOTE: Until otherwise stated, only the Intel GPU variant is supported in
Libreboot.**

Build ROM image from source
---------------------------

The build target, when building from source, is thus:

	./mk -b coreboot hp8460pintel_8mb

Installation
============

Insert binary files
-------------------

If you're using a release ROM, please ensure that you've inserted extra firmware
required refer to the [guide](../install/ivy_has_common) for that. (failure
to adhere to this advice will result in a bricked machine)

Set MAC address
---------------

This platform uses an Intel Flash Descriptor, and defines an Intel GbE NVM
region. As such, release/build ROMs will contain the same MAC address. To
change the MAC address, please read [nvmutil documentation](../install/nvmutil).

Flash a ROM image (software)
-----------------

If you're already running Libreboot, and you don't have flash protection
turned on, [internal flashing](../install/) is possible.

Flash a ROM image (hardware)
-----------------

**REMOVE all power sources like battery, charger and so on, before doing this.
This is to prevent short circuiting and power surges while flashing.**

For general information, please refer to [25xx NOR flash
instructions](../install/spi).

At this present time, disassembly instructions are unavailable from the
Libreboot project, but you can search for HP's own hardware maintenance manual
or look at videos online showing disassembly.

The flash chip is visible by removing the "bottom door" panel. But the
frame makes it hard to put a clip on it, so it's recommended to follow the
HP [service manual](https://h10032.www1.hp.com/ctg/Manual/c03015458.pdf)
to remove the **bottom cover**, as it's called.
