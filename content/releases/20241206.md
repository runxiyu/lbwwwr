Libreboot 20241206 revision is a stable release.

The latest revision is the [8th revision](../20241206rev8/).

## U-Boot UEFI payload on x86_64

U-Boot is now *also* provided as an optional coreboot payload on x86 machines.
This provides a sensible UEFI implementation, useful for booting Linux/BSD
systems more easily. More information available on the [U-Boot x86
page](../uboot/uboot-x86).

This means that you can have a UEFI boot environment, even on machines where
the original vendor firmware never supported it. For example, the ThinkPad X200
runs U-Boot virtually bug-free, and it can boot Linux distros via U-Boot's UEFI
implementation; that machine could not originally do UEFI.

This page lists all changes made since the *Libreboot 20241008* release. Since
Libreboot 20241206 is a stable release, there has been a more conservative focus
on fixing bugs and in general polishing, though several interesting features
have been added, in addition to numerous new motherboards.

## Revision updates

* Updated to Mate Kukri's rewritten release of `deguard`, which now works
  generally for any MEv11-based board, whereas the previous version contained
  hacky hardcoded logic for only the Dell OptiPlex 3050 Micro. In this Libreboot
  release, deguard supports the 3050, but also the ThinkPad T480 and T480S,
  providing machine-specific ME configurations for each motherboard. Mate's new
  deguard implementation essentially does the same thing as Intel's FITC tool,
  though with a much more terse and minimalist design. It could be expanded for
  many other things in the future, related to Intel ME.

* Updated U-Boot to v2024.10 release on ARM64 - and also added this revision
  for x86 coreboot payloads, to provide UEFI on 64-bit x86 machines. The ARM64
  coreboot payload is maintained by Alper Nebi Yasak, and the x86 coreboot
  payload is principally maintained by Simon Glass.

* Updated the Dell OptiPlex 3050 Micro port to use a newer coreboot revision,
  which includes a fix adding PWM fan control, among other things. NOTE: This
  was later obsoleted, because OptiPlex 3050 Micro support was merged upstream
  and Libreboot switched to the upstream revision instead of Gerrit.

* Updated SeaBIOS to latest revision as of 17 October 2024.

* Bumped flashrom to revision d128a0a, which includes a fix for Macronix flash
  chips on ThinkPad W500 whereby it had previously used incorrect erase commands.

## Feature changes

* Implemented an auto-boot timeout on U-Boot payloads, for both ARM and x86.
  This is implemented in the bootflow menu, so that the system will auto-boot
  what is found after a few seconds. Previously, the user had to press enter,
  making headless operation impractical. If the countdown is interrupted with
  a keypress, it is disabled until the next reboot. The current countdown
  delay is 8 seconds, though the U-Boot patch sets a default of 30, which
  Libreboot then overrides via defconfig option.

* `rom.sh`: Support creating SeaUBoot payload setups. This is where SeaBIOS
  loads U-Boot from SeaBIOS first, unless interrupted by the ESC menu, whereby
  the user can select an alternative option, such as direct device booting from
  SeaBIOS, or the GRUB payload instead. This was done, to mitigate potential
  instability in U-Boot, since U-Boot is much more heavily tested so it provides
  a sensible fallback just in case. This could also be regarded as a preventative
  bug fix, from the perspective of a user.

* Experimental U-Boot payload on both 32- and 64-bit x86 setups. The 64-bit
  payload is chainloaded from SeaBIOS and the 32-bit one from GRUB. This is
  useful for booting BSD systems; for example, GPT partitioned OpenBSD can be
  booted with U-Boot, whereas the SeaBIOS payload would require MBR partitioning.

* Imported Riku Viitanen's `int` tool, which was used for debugging MXM
  handling on the HP EliteBook 8560w port; the MXM is a data section provided
  by the system BIOS on mobile systems that use MXM graphics cards. The data
  describes ports, power management and so on. This was needed to make MXM cards
  work reliably.

* Imported Riku Viitanen's `gpio-scripts` fork, which parses inteltool output
  for providing GPIO configuration on new coreboot ports; note that from Skylake
  onward, `intelp2m` is used instead, but Libreboot does not directly import
  the `intelp2m` utility (it is included via coreboot instead).

* Imported Riku Viitanen's `mxmdump` utility, for extracting MXM configuration
  on mobile graphics cards. This was used when implementing MXM support on
  the HP EliteBook 8560w.

## Configuration changes

* Disabled U-Boot on ThinkPad T480, because it's currently buggy there; more
  boards will have U-Boot tweaks made to them, in subsequent hotfixes to
  the Libreboot 20241206 release, and hotfixes to U-Boot itself are also likely,
  since U-Boot still requires a lot more testing. U-Boot does work quite well
  on a number of tested motherboards; if yours works, or doesn't work, please get
  in touch with the Libreboot project, so that a tally can be kept.

* Added Libreboot branding/versioning to the U-Boot bootflow menu, showing
  the Libreboot logo instead of the U-Boot one, and with a purple background
  colour in the console, matching the style used by Libreboot.

* U-Boot (ARM): Alper Nebi Yasak enabled USE with a preboot command at startup.
  This is so that USB keyboards and external disks can be used during the
  boot process; this would have been previously enabled much later in the boot
  process.

* Enabled the coreboot serial console on these targets: Thinkpad X60, HP
  Elite 8200 SFF, HP EliteBook 8460p, HP EliteBook 8560w.

* Enabled U-Boot x86 payload on almost every coreboot board; basically, all
  of the ones with a native coreboot framebuffer (libgfxinit).

* Removed `coreboot/dell7` (for 3050 Micro) and merged it into a new
  tree, `coreboot/next` instead, which was (for this release) later updated to
  the latest coreboot revision from a few days prior to the release. The `next`
  branch contains OptiPlex 780 ports and the Kaby Lake machines such as
  OptiPlex 3050 Micro or ThinkPad T480/T480S.

* Removed the FSP submodule from `coreboot/default`, because it's currently
  used in `coreboot/next` instead (for Kaby Lake machines).

* Enabled support in coreboot, on Dell OptiPlex 3050 Micro, for Coffee Lake CPUs.
  With a special pin mod (currently untested as of 6 December 2024), Kaby Lake
  machines can make use of 8th-gen Coffee Lake CPUs, which offer greater
  performance and power efficiency.

## Bug fixes

The following bug fixes have been merged (in descending order from the latest
changes to the earliest changes):

* `script/trees`: Reset the PATH environmental variable per target, to what it
  was when the script was first called. This is because PATH is manipulated
  when dealing with crossgcc, exporting it prior to running a given build
  process, if the current project/target enables cross compilation. This bug
  didn't cause any issues in practise, so this is a preventative bug fix,
  because projects that use the crossgcc compiler all set `xarch` properly,
  and none of the projects that aren't cross compiled use special prefixes
  in their toolchain references, at least as of 6 December 2024.

* Add U-Boot first, on x86 coreboot targets, even though it doesn't execute
  first, because U-Boot has to be inserted at a specific offset. This avoids
  potential overlap errors in cbfstool, if it were to be added later on. This
  bug didn't cause any issues in practise, so it is theoretical in nature and
  therefore a preventative bug fix.

* `rom.sh`: Removed redundant shebang, which didn't technically cause any
  problems, but it's technically a bug since this is not provided as a main
  script, and must never be executed directly, instead only to be executed by
  other scripts.

* Added missing `openssl-devel-engine` to Fedora 41 build dependencies.

* U-Boot: Merged an x86 patch from Simon Glass, that makes U-Boot skip clearing
  the VESA display an startup, since this is already done by the VESA driver.
  In some cases, you may want to keep what was previously on the screen, like
  for logos and such. We currently do not use U-Boot on VESA setups in Libreboot,
  as of 6 December 2024.

* U-Boot: Merged an x86 patch from Simon Glass, that makes U-Boot silently
  disable serial console output, where one is not available; previously, it
  would crash if one wasn't available, on x86 machines.

* `script/trees`: Unset the `CROSS_COMPILE` environmental variable, to fix an
  issue whereby projects that honour it might be wrongly cross compiled where
  a previous export of that variable was made; for example, setting it on
  arm64 U-Boot and then compiling x86 U-Boot, where the latter currently relies
  on the host's x86\_64 toolchain, on an x86\_64 host.

* Enabled the legacy 8254 timer on Dell OptiPlex 3050 Micro, to work around a
  hanging bug in SeaBIOS. This board was previously GRUB only, but now once again
  uses a more flexible SeaGRUB setup like other motherboards do. The static option
  table was also disabled.

* Merged a patch from Nicholas Chin, that tells the MEC5035 EC to send a correct
  shutdown signal to the operating system when the power button is pressed.
  Prior to this fix, pressing the power button on Dell Latitude laptops would
  result in the system turning off, but the OS would be unaware of this fact
  so file systems (for example) would not be cleanly unmounted.

* Merged a patch from Mate Kukri, fixing PWM fan controls on the Dell OptiPlex
  3050 Micro. Previously, the fans always ran at a very low speed even under
  stress conditions, leading to over-heating; the system now runs reliably.

* Removed end slashes in repository links within `config/git`, because of
  how caching works in Libreboot; fewer projects now fail to cache, making
  the download process more redundant and fault tolerant at build time when
  downloading upstream sources.

* `vendor.sh`: Don't use the `x_` wrapper for handling errors while changing
  GbE MAC addresses, because a file path is provided as argument, and the `x_`
  wrapper currently does not handle globbing; instead, the `$err` function is
  used for returning error status.

* `vendor.sh`: Properly handle error status when returning from deguard's
  RUNME script (**This change was later obsoleted when deguard was rewritten,
  and Libreboot imported the newly rewritten version - the new code and handling
  of it is much more robust**)

* Added missing `python3-devel` to Fedora 40 build dependencies.

## General code cleanup

* Removed unnecessary coreboot submodule configs, for trees that no
  longer exist such as `coreboot/haswell` or `coreboot/dell7`.

* Removed the following unnecessary coreboot patches in the default tree:
  VRAM patches (VRAM allocation is dynamic in modern OSes, so the fixed higher
  size merely wastes system RAM needlessly on Intel GPUs when not a lot of VRAM
  is needed). Removed redundancy patches for coreboot's buildgcc download logic,
  because lbmk now handles this outside of coreboot.

This accounts for 79 changes made, relative to Libreboot 20241008. Many changes
were intentionally delayed because this is to be a stable release. A lot of new
work will now go into the next testing release, which is scheduled for the
latter part of January 2025 or early February 2025.

If you spot any issues in the Libreboot 20241206 release, please do get in
contact with the Libreboot project. We appreciate any and all help. Thank you
for reading, and have a wonderful day!
