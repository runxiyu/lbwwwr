title: Do not use CH341A!
toc: true
---

**Summary: If you don't have one already, there is no reason to buy one ever.
The Raspberry Pi Pico is superior in all ways.**

NOR flashes on Libreboot systems run on 3.3V or 1.8V DC. CH341A can have 5V
logic levels on data lines, which will damage your SPI flash, southbridge, and
anything else it is connected to.

These CH341A programmers are unfortunately very popular; **do not use it**
unless you have fixed the data line voltages.

Most people would not bother to fix their CH341As before using them, so we
discourage their use and do not provide documentation.

## The issue

We are aware that some CH341As (e.g. the green one) can operate at 3.3V. The
data lines switch to 3.3V during an erase, read, or write cycle. When no flash
operation is underway, the data lines usually output negligeble current.
However:

* There are many scenarios where this 5V idle logic level could still be
  applied such as surge events.
* The drive level is extremely poor, making ISP flashing ill advised (e.g. when
  PCH on Intel platforms is partly active and data lines have low resistance on
  some boards).
* The WP/HOLD lines are connected directly to VCC, instead of using a pull-up
  resistor, easily causing over-currents.
* Crap LDO, and no ESD/overcurrent protection, likely unable to provide much
  current on VCC, especially in ISP flashing where the flash shares a common
  power rail with many other components.

## The alternative

Get a Raspberry Pi Pico. It's about the same price, but has much better
electrical design, supports a much higher 12mA drive level, can control
multiple chip selects at once, has libre boot firmware itself, is completely
reprogrammable (so you can repurpose it for other projects when you're done
flashing Libreboot), etc.

## When is the CH341A appropriate to use?

The only instance where the CH341A is viable is when flashing a loose chip in
its DIP-8 ZIF socket, which could be connected to WSON-8/SOIC-8/SOIC-16 via
adapters. There are also adapters to convert voltages to 1.8V.

Even so, we recommend the Raspberry Pi Pico, which could easily be wired to
a breadboard for socket flashing. With about the same price you get a good
device for ISP flashing, socket flashing, and for any other electronics project
that could be done on the Pico.

## Could I still use a CH341A despite these issues?

We recommend against the CH341A even with modifications. But anyway:

### Option 1: Fixing the CH341A (incl. pull-up resistors on WP/HOLD)

Firstly, complete
[this guide](https://www.eevblog.com/forum/repair/ch341a-serial-memory-programmer-power-supply-fix/).

Then:

In the event of a surge such as a short, a directly-connected WP/HOLD could
cause a direct short between VCC/ground, which would damage circuitry and
potentially cause a fire. Unfortunately, they are directly connected to 3.3V
VCC on CH341A dongles.

You should cut these two connections to the WP and HOLD pins.

If you are performing in-system programming of a chip when it is inside the
motherboard, it is likely that your motherboard already has pull-up resistors,
so you could stop here.

If you want to flash chips in the ZIF socket, you must jump the cuts with
pull-up resistors (between 1k to 10k ohms) instead.


These photos show both modifications (3.3V logic and WP/HOLD pull-up resistors)
performed, on the black CH341A:

<!-- TODO:
If pull-up resistors exist both on e.g. the laptop
motherboard and on the CH341A, it just means the equivalent series resistance
will be of the two resistors (on each line) in parallel. If we assume that
a laptop is likely to have a resistor size of ~3.3k for pull-ups, then a value
of ~5.6k ohms on the CH341A side seems reasonable.

### Option 2: Using a logic level converter

Just use them according to the documentation of your logic level converter.
