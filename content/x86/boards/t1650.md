Introduction
============

**Unavailable in Libreboot 20230625 or earlier. You must [compile from
source](../build/), or use at least Libreboot 20231021.**

[Vendor information](https://i.dell.com/sites/csdocuments/Shared-Content_data-Sheets_Documents/en/uk/Dell_Precision_T1650_Spec_Sheet.pdf)

This is similar code-wise to [Dell
OptiPlex 9010](https://doc.coreboot.org/motherboard/dell/optiplex_9010.html)
which coreboot supports.

Build ROM image from source
---------------------------

The build target, when building from source, is thus:

	./mk -b coreboot t1650_12mb

Installation
============

Insert binary files
-------------------

If you're using a release ROM, please ensure that you've inserted extra firmware
required refer to the [guide](../install/ivy_has_common) for that. (failure
to adhere to this advice will result in a bricked machine)

Libreboot's build system automatically downloads and processes these files if
you build Libreboot from source, but the same logic that it uses must be re-run
if you're using a release image.

Set MAC address
---------------

This platform uses an Intel Flash Descriptor, and defines an Intel GbE NVM
region. As such, release/build ROMs will contain the same MAC address. To
change the MAC address, please read [nvmutil documentation](../install/nvmutil).

WARNING about CPU/GPU compatibility
-------------------------------

At the time of testing this board, I didn't have a CPU with graphics built in,
so I could only use discrete graphics on the PCI-E slot (in my case, Nvidia
Quadro K420 running under the nouveau driver in Linux).

If you want to use onboard graphics, you must have a CPU that has a GPU built
into it. The [Ivy Bridge
Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ivy_Bridge_(microarchitecture)) has a
list of them.

**NOT ALL CPUs support ECC memory. You must use one that supports it, if you
want to have the ECC feature, or else it won't work. ECC allows for error
correction, mitigating certain defects that develop over time in the RAM (it
will not account for all defects, and memory always needs to be replaced
eventually) - with ECC RAM, this machine is more suitable to applications where
data integrity matters.**

Because of this, Libreboot currently only provides ROM images where SeaBIOS
is the first payload, and SeaBIOS is relied upon the execute the VGA ROM that's
stored on the graphics card. However, coreboot's libgfxinit is also enabled,
so onboard graphics *should* work if you don't have a graphics card installed.

Coreboot has libre initialisation code for Intel graphics, but libre
initialisation code is not available for most graphics cards. This machine can
take any graphics card that fits in the PCI-E slot.

GRUB *also* works, from SeaBIOS when the machine is booted in text mode. Both
coreboot GRUB, and BIOS GRUB provided by your (Linux) distro. It's done this
way (SeaBIOS first) because Libreboot's configuration does not tell *coreboot*
to execute VGA Option ROMs, and it's important that we try to prevent bricks
whenever possible.

Flash a ROM image (software)
-----------------

If you're already running Libreboot, and you don't have flash protection
turned on, [internal flashing](../install/) is possible.

Internal flashing is *also* possible from the factory BIOS, if you set the
service mode jumper. This shorts `HDA_SDO` (Soft Descriptor Override), which
disables the ME after early bringup and disables IFD-based flash protections.

Observe, below the PCI slots:

<img tabindex=1 style="max-width:35%;" src="https://av.libreboot.org/t1650/t1650_motherboard.jpg" /><span class="f"><img src="https://av.libreboot.org/t1650/t1650_motherboard.jpg" /></span>

Here is a close-up:

<img tabindex=1 style="max-width:35%;" src="https://av.libreboot.org/t1650/t1650_service_mode.jpg" /><span class="f"><img src="https://av.libreboot.org/t1650/t1650_service_mode.jpg" /></span>

Simply short those pins, on the header, using a jumper. When you do this, all
flash protections will be disabled.

Flash a ROM image (hardware)
-----------------

**REMOVE all power sources and connectors from the machine, before doing this.
This is to prevent short circuiting and power surges while flashing.**

For general information, please refer to [25xx NOR flash
instructions](../install/spi) - that page refers to use of socketed flash.

This machine is somewhat cumbersome to flash, because it has a SOIC-16 flash
for the first 8MB part, and 4MB SOIC8. You can split up your 12MB ROM image
like so:

	dd if=libreboot.rom of=4mb.rom bs=1M skip=8
	dd if=libreboot.rom of=8mb.rom bs=1M count=8

The side cover comes off easily, and you can find the flash ICs next to the RAM.

Here's the SOIC8 IC being flashed:

and here is the SOIC16 IC being flashed:

Here is SeaBIOS after a successful boot attempt:

Here is GRUB:

and here is Mozilla Firefox in Debian booted on T1650, showing the Libreboot
flashing instructions [in Chinese](../install/spi.zh-cn):

Other aspects of the machine are not much to write home about. It's a standard
desktop PC form factor, and you can just run whatever you want on it.

Enjoy!
