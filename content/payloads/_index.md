title: Payloads
---

A payload is the program that runs on the system after coreboot has initialized
the hardware. The payload is usually a bootloader, or something that could load
bootloaders.

Libreboot currently supports three payloads: SeaBIOS, GRUB2, and U-Boot.
(SeaBIOS is not available on ARM.)
