Dell Latitude E6400
===================

**If you haven't bought an R400 yet: the [Dell Latitude
E6400](../install/latitude) is much easier to flash; no disassembly required,
it can be flashed entirely in software from Dell BIOS to Libreboot. It is the
same hardware generation (GM45), with same CPUs, video processor, etc.**

Introduction
============

It is believed that all or most R400 laptops are compatible. See notes
about [CPU
compatibility](#cpu_compatibility) for
potential incompatibilities.

There are two possible flash chip sizes for the R400: 4MiB (32Mbit) or
8MiB (64Mbit). This can be identified by the type of flash chip below
the palmrest: 4MiB is SOIC-8, 8MiB is SOIC-16.

*The R400 laptops come with the ME (and sometimes AMT in addition)
before flashing libreboot. libreboot disables and removes it by using a
modified descriptor: see [../install/ich9utils.md](../install/ich9utils)*
(contains notes, plus instructions)

Flashing instructions can be found at
[../install/\#flashprog](../install/#flashprog)

**NOTE: Libreboot standardises on [flashprog](https://flashprog.org/wiki/Flashprog)
now, as of 27 January 2024, which is a fork of flashrom.
The reason why was explained, in
the [Libreboot 20240225 release](../../news/libreboot20240225.md#flashprog-now-used-instead-of-flashrom)**

EC update {#ecupdate}
=========

It is recommended that you update to the latest EC firmware version. The
[EC firmware](../../faq.md#ec-embedded-controller-firmware) is separate from
libreboot, so we don't actually provide that, but if you still have
Lenovo BIOS then you can just run the Lenovo BIOS update utility, which
will update both the BIOS and EC version. See:

-   [../install/#flashprog](../install/#flashprog)
-   <http://www.thinkwiki.org/wiki/BIOS_update_without_optical_disk>

NOTE: this can only be done when you are using Lenovo BIOS. How to
update the EC firmware while running libreboot is unknown. libreboot
only replaces the BIOS firmware, not EC.

Updated EC firmware has several advantages e.g. better battery
handling.

The R400 is almost identical to the X200, code-wise. See
[x200.md](x200).

TODO: put hardware register logs here like on the [X200](x200) and
[T400](t400) page.

Installation notes
==================

[External flashing](spi) required, if Lenovo BIOS is running.

**If you haven't bought an R400 yet: the [Dell Latitude
E6400](latitude) is much easier to flash; no disassembly required,
it can be flashed entirely in software from Dell BIOS to Libreboot. It is the
same hardware generation (GM45), with same CPUs, video processor, etc.**

Initial flashing instructions for R400.

This guide is for those who want libreboot on their ThinkPad R400 while
they still have the original Lenovo BIOS present. This guide can also be
followed (adapted) if you brick your R400, to know how to recover.

Before following this section, please make sure to setup your libreboot
ROM properly first. Although ROM images are provided pre-built in
libreboot, there are some modifications that you need to make to the one
you chose before flashing. (instructions referenced later in this guide)

Serial port {#serial_port}
-----------

EHCI debug might not be needed. It has been reported that the docking
station for this laptop has a serial port, so it might be possible to
use that instead.

A note about CPUs
=================

[ThinkWiki](http://www.thinkwiki.org/wiki/Category:R400) has a list of
CPUs for this system. The Core 2 Duo P8400 and P8600 are believed to
work in libreboot. The Core 2 Duo T9600 was confirmed to work, so the
T9400 probably also works. *The Core 2 Duo T5870/5670 and Celeron M
575/585 are untested!*

Quad-core CPUs
--------------

Incompatible. Do not use.

A note about GPUs
=================

Some models have an Intel GPU, while others have both an ATI and an
Intel GPU; this is referred to as "Dual Graphics" (previously
"switchable graphics"). In the *BIOS setup* program for lenovobios,
you can specify that the system will use one or the other (but not
both).

libreboot is known to work on systems with only the Intel GPU, using
native graphics initialization. On systems with switchable graphics, the
Intel GPU is used and the ATI GPU is disabled, so native graphics
initialization works all the same.

CPU paste required
==================

See [\#paste](#paste).

Flash chip size {#flashchips}
===============

Use this to find out:

	flashprog -p internal

**NOTE: Libreboot standardises on [flashprog](https://flashprog.org/wiki/Flashprog)
now, as of 27 January 2024, which is a fork of flashrom.
The reason why was explained, in
the [Libreboot 20240225 release](../../news/libreboot20240225.md#flashprog-now-used-instead-of-flashrom)**

MAC address {#macaddress}
===========

Refer to [mac\_address.md](../install/mac_address).

External flashing
=================

Refer to [spi.md](spi) as a guide for external re-flashing.

next to the memory slots:\

Now, you should be ready to install libreboot.

Read [this article](spi) to learn how you may flash the chip, which is near
to the RAM.

Thermal paste (IMPORTANT)
=========================

Because part of this procedure involved removing the heatsink, you will
need to apply new paste. Arctic MX-4 is ok. You will also need isopropyl
alcohol and an anti-static cloth to clean with.

When re-installing the heatsink, you must first clean off all old paste
with the alcohol/cloth. Then apply new paste. Arctic MX-4 is also much
better than the default paste used on these systems.

![](https://av.libreboot.org/t400/paste.jpg)

NOTE: the photo above is for illustration purposes only, and does not
show how to properly apply the thermal paste. Other guides online detail
the proper application procedure.

Memory
======

In DDR3 machines with Cantiga (GM45/GS45/PM45), northbridge requires sticks
that will work as PC3-8500 (faster PC3/PC3L sticks can work as PC3-8500).
Non-matching pairs may not work. Single module (meaning, one of the slots
will be empty) will currently only work in slot 0.

NOTE: according to users reports, non matching pairs (e.g. 1+2 GiB) might
work in some cases.

Make sure that the RAM you buy is the 2Rx8 configuration when buying 4GiB sticks
(In other words: maximum of 2GiB per rank, 2 ranks per card).

[This page](http://www.forum.thinkpads.com/viewtopic.php?p=760721) might
be useful for RAM compatibility info (note: coreboot raminit is
different, so this page might be BS)

The following photo shows 8GiB (2x4GiB) of RAM installed:\
