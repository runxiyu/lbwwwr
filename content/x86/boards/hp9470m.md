Introduction
============

HP EliteBook Folio 9470m is a 14" ultrabook with a backlit keyboard.

Libreboot has support for this, in the Git repository and release versions
from Libreboot 20230423 onwards.

Installation of Libreboot
=========================

You must first compile the Libreboot ROM

    ./mk -b coreboot hp9470m_16mb

More information about building ROM images can be found in
the [build guide](../build).

This is an *Ivybridge* board which means that a neutered ME image is required
if you wish to flash the ME region. Libreboot's build system automatically
downloads, neuters (using `me_cleaner`) and inserts this if compiling from
source.

If you're using *Libreboot release* ROM images, the ME image has been scrubbed
and you must re-insert it. Use the information on this guide to know how
to do that:
[Insert vendor files on Intel Sandybridge/Ivybridge/Haswell
platforms](../install/ivy_has_common)

You may also wish to change the *default MAC address* if you're planning to
use the onboard Intel Gigabit Ethernet. You can do this using the information
in the same guide linked above, or read the nvmutil manual:

[Modify MAC addresses with nvmutil](../install/nvmutil).

Disassembly
-----------

Remove the battery.

Open the two screws marked with the three-disc icons.
Slide the HDD panel out and remove it.

The flash chip is now comfortably accessible. Now refer to the
[external programming guide](../install/spi.html) for guidance on how
to program Libreboot on it.

Some part of the board might turn on when programming. If programming fails,
you might have to attach the laptop to a charger. Make sure the laptop
powers off before running flashprog. No LEDs should be lit.
