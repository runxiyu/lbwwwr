The Libreboot logo was created by Marcus Moeller. It is released to the
public domain under the terms of the [Creative Commons Zero license, version
1.0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/legalcode).

The sticker files, based on that logo, are made by Patrick McDermott in 2015,
also released under CC0.

The font on the sticker designs is `lato`. Install this, otherwise the vectors
won't look correct for the text.
