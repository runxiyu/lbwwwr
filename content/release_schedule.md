title: Release Schedule
---

We normally just do a release and that's it. It's still tentative, and this
may change, but it has so far been decided that the 2025 release schedule will
look like this:

* April 13th: testing release
* June 12th: stable release
* October 31st: testing release
* December 6th: stable release

Where any release is made, revisions such as 20241206 revision 8 can be
re-released. <!-- TODO: what does this mean --> On stable releases, only the
most desirable improvements and fixes will be made, without substantially
altering the substance of the original release, while testing releases can have
wilder revisions; where the current release is a testinng release, revisions
should be frozen in place about 1 month before the scheduled stable release.

This is preferable because it offers much more flexibility, and it means that
stable releases can be closer to upstream whereas previously they'd be about
3&ndash;6 months behind, e.g. the Libreboot 20241206 release uses coreboot
revisions from the summer of 2024, but some of them are closer to December of
2024.
