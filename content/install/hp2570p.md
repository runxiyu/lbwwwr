Brief board info
================

Vendor info here:

<https://support.hp.com/us-en/document/c03412731>

Installation of Libreboot
=========================

Coreboot also has some information:

<https://doc.coreboot.org/mainboard/hp/2560p.html#programming>

If you're using *Libreboot release* ROM images, the ME image has been scrubbed
and you must re-insert it. Use the information on this guide to know how
to do that:

[Insert vendor files on Intel Sandybridge/Ivybridge/Haswell
platforms](../install/ivy_has_common)

Make sure to set the MAC address in the flash:
[Modify MAC addresses with nvmutil](../install/nvmutil).

Refer to the [Libreboot flashing guides](../install/spi)
