title: Dell OptiPlex 7010/9010 SFF
x-toc-enable: true
---

**This is only for the SFF variant. The MT variant is also supported, but for
the MT variant, you must flash the [T1650 ROM image](t1650) instead.**

**[PLEASE READ THESE INSTRUCTIONS BEFORE INSTALLING](ivy_has_common), OR
YOU MAY BRICK YOUR MACHINE!! - Please click the link and follow the instructions
there, before flashing. For posterity,
[here is the link again](ivy_has_common).**

Introduction
============

**Unavailable in Libreboot 20240612 or earlier. You must [compile from
source](../build/), or use a version newer than Libreboot 20240612.**

Official information about the computer can be found here:
<https://www.dell.com/support/manuals/en-uk/optiplex-7010-plus-small-ff/opti_7010_sff_plus_om/specifications-of-optiplex-small-form-factor-plus-7010?guid=guid-7c9f07ce-626e-44ca-be3a-a1fb036413f9&lang=en-us>

Build ROM image from source
---------------------------

The build target, when building from source, is thus:

	./mk -b coreboot dell7010sff_12mb

NOTE: The same 7010 SFF image also works on 9010 SFF. It's the same mainboard.

Installation
============

Insert binary files
-------------------

If you're using a release ROM, please ensure that you've inserted extra firmware
required refer to the [guide](../install/ivy_has_common) for that. (failure
to adhere to this advice will result in a bricked machine)

Libreboot's build system automatically downloads and processes these files if
you build Libreboot from source, but the same logic that it uses must be re-run
if you're using a release image.

Set MAC address
---------------

This platform uses an Intel Flash Descriptor, and defines an Intel GbE NVM
region. As such, release/build ROMs will contain the same MAC address. To
change the MAC address, please read [nvmutil documentation](../install/nvmutil).

WARNING about CPU/GPU compatibility
-------------------------------

If you want to use onboard graphics, you must have a CPU that has a GPU built
into it. You can find a list here:

<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ivy_Bridge_(microarchitecture)>

Coreboot has libre initialisation code for Intel graphics, but libre
initialisation code is not available for most graphics cards. This machine can
take any graphics card that fits in the PCI-E slot. When a graphics card is
used, SeaBIOS executes its VGA ROM which provides video init, instead of
coreboot's native Intel video init. GRUB piggybacks off of what SeaBIOS did,
so the GRUB payload will also work.

Flash a ROM image (software)
-----------------

If you're already running Libreboot, and you don't have flash protection
turned on, [internal flashing](../install/) is possible.

If you have factory firmware (Dell), you can short the service jumper. It's
near the RAM, under where the HDD goes (click the photos shown above).
Just put a short on it when booting,
and all flash protection is disabled; the factory firmware write might EFI
variables to flash during shutdown sequence, so you should *pull the plug* to
shut it down (remove the power by pulling the plug) after flashprog
says `VERIFIED`.

Flash a ROM image (hardware)
-----------------

For general information, please refer to [25xx NOR flash
instructions](../install/spi) - that page refers to use of socketed flash.

This machine is somewhat cumbersome to flash, because it has a SOIC-16 flash
for the first 8MB part, and 4MB SOIC8. You can split up your 12MB ROM image
like so:

	dd if=libreboot.rom of=4mb.rom bs=1M skip=8
	dd if=libreboot.rom of=8mb.rom bs=1M count=8

The side cover comes off easily, and you can find the flash ICs next to the RAM.

No photos yet, but the two flash ICs are next to each other, and near to where
the PCH is.
