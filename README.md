# Unofficial Libreboot Documentation

This is my attempt to make Libreboot documentation more accessible and
streamlined.

I expect to merge this into the main documentation some time in the future.
This would likely take a while because Libreboot documentation is rather
complex and I'm busy with schoolwork.

Contributions are very welcome. Send a PR on
[the Codeberg repo](https://codeberg.org/runxiyu/lbwwwr)
or email patches to
[~runxiyu/public-inbox@lists.sr.ht](https://lists.sr.ht/~runxiyu/public-inbox).
