**This board is known to have non-functioning video init.** See [notabug issue
136](https://notabug.org/libreboot/lbmk/issues/136).

## Introduction

This page contains information about assembly and disassembly, for flashing
the ASUS Chromebook C201 externally. It will also link to internal flashing
instructions, and information about U-Boot.

## Flashrom

Google's fork of flashrom is required. See the generic [chromebook flashing
instructions](chromebooks).

## U-boot payload

U-Boot was ported to coreboot CrOS devices, courtesy of Alper Nebi Yasak
(`alpernebbi` on Libreboot IRC).

## Internal flashing

The generic [chromebook flashing instructions](chromebooks) work.

You must turn the write-protect screw though.

There are 8 screws to remove from the bottom of the device. Two are hidden
under the top pads. After removing the screws, the keyboard plastic part can be
carefully detached from the rest. Beware: there are cables attached to it! It
is advised to flip the keyboard plastic part over. The write protect screw is
located next to the SPI flash chip, circled in red in the picture below. It has
to be removed. photos:

The write protect screw can be put back in place later, when the device
is known to be in a working state.

## External flashing


If the machine is no longer booting, due to bad firmware, you can unbrick
it externally. Refer to [external flash instructions](spi).

[Battery connector](https://av.libreboot.org/c201/battery-connector.jpg)

You do not need to correct the `WP#` pin because it is held high via pull-up
resistor to 3.3v, when the write-protect screw is loosened (when tightened,
the screw grounds this pin; the pull-up resistor is to prevent a dead short).

You must remove the battery, prior to flashing. The connector is shown in
the 2nd photo, above (the big black connector, with the black, green, yellow,
white and red wires going into it). Simply unplug that.
